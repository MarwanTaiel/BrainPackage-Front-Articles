"b'Standing on the Shoulders of Solitude: Newton, the Plague, and How Quarantine Fomented the Greatest Leap in Science'",b'\xe2\x80\x9cTruth is the offspring of silence and meditation.\xe2\x80\x9d',"b'\nIn the 1650s, the penumbra of plague slowly began eclipsing Europe. Italy fell first, soon Spain, then Germany, then Holland. From across the slender cell wall of the Channel, England watched and trembled, then cautiously relaxed \xe2\x80\x94 for about a decade, some divine will seemed to be shielding the country. But the world was already worshipping at the altar of commerce and the forces of globalization had already been set into motion \xe2\x80\x94 with England\xe2\x80\x99s economy relying heavily on trade, its ports bustled with ships carrying silk and tea and sugar from all discovered frontiers of the globe. Rats boarded the ships, fleas boarded the rats, bacteria \xe2\x80\x94 an almost-kingdom of unicellular organisms yet to be coronated, for the cell itself was yet to be discovered \xe2\x80\x94 boarded the fleas, which took to human flesh as soon as they debarked. \nThe Ghost of a Flea by William Blake  (Tate Britain)\nAnd so, on Christmas Day 1664, a single plague death was reported in London. Another came in February, then another. \xe2\x80\x9cGreat fears of sickness here in the City,\xe2\x80\x9d the legendary diarist Samuel Pepys was writing by April. \xe2\x80\x9cGod preserve us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGod was no match for the absence of a basic scientific understanding of biology and epidemiology. The deaths were swift, gruesome, and, soon, so voluminous that services ceased being held. Over the course of the summer, the death toll swelled tenfold, from hundreds to thousands per week. The infected were ordered not to leave their homes. Many were boarded in and left to die in isolation, an enormous cross painted on the outside of each plagued house. Plays, spectator blood sports, and other crowd gatherings were banned. The universities closed and sent the students home. \nWhen Cambridge closed, a young man obsessed with mathematics, motion, and light, whose illiterate father had died three months before his birth, who had begun his studies at Cambridge by performing servants\xe2\x80\x99 work for wealthier students in exchange for tuition, and who worshipped a \xe2\x80\x9cGod of order and not of confusion,\xe2\x80\x9d bundled his prized books and headed back to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s farm. \nThere, in solitude and isolation, as the plague continued its deadly sweep, Isaac Newton (December 25, 1642\xe2\x80\x93March 19, 1727) dreamt up the fulcrum that would dislodge humanity from the Dark Ages; there, the apple \xe2\x80\x94 real or apocryphal \xe2\x80\x94 fell, and in its shadow rose the revolutionary idea of gravity, which the young man envisioned as a force \xe2\x80\x9cextending to the orb of the Moon\xe2\x80\x9d all the way from the Earth, without \xe2\x80\x9ccutoff or boundary.\xe2\x80\x9d It was there, too, that he set out to compute that force, \xe2\x80\x9crequisite to keep the Moon in her Orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth\xe2\x80\x9d; in the act of computing it, as a necessity of that act, he invented calculus. \nIsaac Newton\nIn his excellent Isaac Newton (public library) \xe2\x80\x94 a gold standard of biography and of storytelling bridging the scientific with the poetic, which also gave us the story behind the famous \xe2\x80\x9cstanding on the shoulders of giants\xe2\x80\x9d metaphor \xe2\x80\x94 James Gleick writes of the young Newton\xe2\x80\x99s plague-driven return home:\nHe built bookshelves and made a small study for himself. He opened the nearly blank thousand-page commonplace book he had inherited from his stepfather and named it his Waste Book. He began filling it with reading notes. These mutated seamlessly into original research. He set himself problems; considered them obsessively; calculated answers, and asked new questions. He pushed past the frontier of knowledge (though he did not know this). The plague year was his transfiguration. Solitary and almost incommunicado, he became the world\xe2\x80\x99s paramount mathematician.\nNewton by William Blake (Tate Britain)\nFrom the fortunate platform of a long life \xe2\x80\x94 he lived to eighty-four, more than double the era\xe2\x80\x99s life expectancy, his casket shouldered by dukes and earls \xe2\x80\x94 Newton would look back on his most intellectually fertile period of the plague years with the recognition that \xe2\x80\x9ctruth is the offspring of silence and meditation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nComplement this fragment of Gleick\xe2\x80\x99s indispensable Isaac Newton with Tocqueville on stillness as a form of action and the trailblazing 18th-century French mathematician \xc3\x89milie du Ch\xc3\xa2telet, who popularized Newton\xe2\x80\x99s science, on the nature of genius, then revisit Gleick\xe2\x80\x99s splendid reading of and reflection on Elizabeth Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s poem about the nature of knowledge.\n'"
"b'Virginia Woolf on Finding Beauty in the Uncertainty of Time, Space, and Being'",b'Calibration and consolation for those moments when it seems impossible that we should ever again recompose the world\xe2\x80\x99s broken fragments into a harmonious whole. ',"b'\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should we like it were stars to burn with a passion for us we could not return?\xe2\x80\x9d asked W.H. Auden in one of the greatest poems ever written \xe2\x80\x94 a subtle, playful, poignant meditation on what it takes to go on living \xe2\x80\x94 to go on making poems and symphonies and equations, to go on loving \xe2\x80\x94 when faced with something so much vaster than we are, so beyond our control and so rife with uncertainty, be it the chance-governed universe enfolding us or the sovereign cosmos of another heart.\nA generation before him, Virginia Woolf (January 25, 1882\xe2\x80\x93March 28, 1941) \xe2\x80\x94 another subtle illuminator of the human spirit in its cosmic dimensions \xe2\x80\x94 shone a sidewise gleam on the blunt edge of that eternal question of how to live with, and perhaps even find beauty, in the elemental uncertainty of time, space, and being \xe2\x80\x94 a suddenly sharpened at times of especial uncertainty. \nArt by Nina Cosford from the illustrated biography of Virginia Woolf\nIn one of the most ravishing passages from her 1927 masterwork To the Lighthouse (public library | free ebook) \xe2\x80\x94 the most autobiographical of her novels \xe2\x80\x94 Woolf writes:\nWhat after all is one night? A short space, especially when the darkness dims so soon, and so soon a bird sings, a cock crows, or a faint green quickens, like a turning leaf, in the hollows of the wave. Night, however, succeeds to night. The winter holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally, evenly, with indefatigable fingers. They lengthen; they darken. Some of them hold aloft clear planets, plates of brightness. The autumn trees, ravaged as they are, take on the flesh of tattered flags kindling in the doom of cool cathedral caves where gold letters on marble pages describe death in battle and how bones bleach and burn far away in Indian sands. The autumn trees gleam in the yellow moonlight, in the light of harvest moons, the light which mellows the energy of labour, and smooths the stubble, and brings the wave lapping blue to the shore.\nArt by Margaret C. Cook for a rare 1913 edition of Leaves of Grass. (Available as a print.)\nIn the breaking waves, Woolf finds a staggering emblem of our struggle to hold the larger wholeness in view, in faith, when our worlds come momentarily disworlded:\nIt seems impossible that their calm should ever return or that we should ever compose from their fragments a perfect whole or read in the littered pieces the clear words of truth.\nRadiating from Woolf\xe2\x80\x99s gorgeous words is the reminder that all states of mind, all territories of feeling, even those that feel most unsurvivable \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps especially those that feel most unsurvivable \xe2\x80\x94 are merely moments in time, and yet they are not islanded in the river of being but belong with the rest of the current, the current that springs from the selfsame source as our capacity for beauty, for transcendence, for experiencing ourselves as \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing itself\xe2\x80\x9d:\nThe nights now are full of wind and destruction; the trees plunge and bend and their leaves fly helter skelter until the lawn is plastered with them and they lie packed in gutters and choke rain pipes and scatter damp paths. Also the sea tosses itself and breaks itself, and should any sleeper fancying that he might find on the beach an answer to his doubts, a sharer of his solitude, throw off his bedclothes and go down by himself to walk on the sand, no image with semblance of serving and divine promptitude comes readily to hand bringing the night to order and making the world reflect the compass of the soul. The hand dwindles in his hand; the voice bellows in his ear. Almost it would appear that it is useless in such confusion to ask the night those questions as to what, and why, and wherefore, which tempt the sleeper from his bed to seek an answer.\nArt by Margaret C. Cook for a rare 1913 edition of Leaves of Grass. (Available as a print)\nIf you have survived your life so far without reading To the Lighthouse, and suddenly find yourself with new orders of time, space, and being on your hands, this might be the moment to savor Woolf\xe2\x80\x99s timeless treasure \xe2\x80\x94 the kind of book that leaves you feeling nothing less than reborn. Complement this particular fragment with an antidote to helplessness and  disorientation from the great humanistic philosopher and psychologist Erich Fromm, then revisit Woolf on being ill, why we read, what it means to be an artist, the relationship between loneliness and creativity, and her transcendent account of a total solar eclipse.\n'"
b'Stillness as a Form of Action: Tocqueville on Cataclysm as an Antidote to Cultural Complacency and a Catalyst for Growth',"b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are periods during which human society seems to rest\xe2\x80\xa6 This pause is, indeed, only apparent, for time does not stop its course for nations any more than for [individuals]; they are all advancing every day towards a goal with which they are unacquainted.\xe2\x80\x9d'","b'\nEven when nothing is happening, something is happening. This is a difficult fact for the human animal to fathom \xe2\x80\x94 especially for us modern sapiens, who so ardently worship at the altar of productivity and so readily mistake busyness for effectiveness, for propulsion toward progress. Silence is a form of speech, Susan Sontag wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cand an element in a dialogue.\xe2\x80\x9d Stillness is a form of action and an element in advancement, in evolution, in all forward motion. \nThere are certain moments, as when winter cusps into spring, when nature itself reminds us of this slippery elemental fact: Buds begin to spine the skeletal silhouettes of trees, withholding leaf and blossom until it is right, until it is safe to spill new life into the chilly air; birds, whose dinosaur bodies have spent all winter preparing to mate, perch silent on the bud-spined branches, all longing and unsung song. \nWaiting in the Almost by Maria Popova. Available as a print.\nThere are certain moments in culture, too, when we must especially remember, in order to stay sane, this slippery elemental fact.\nThose moments and their neglected significance are what Alexis de Tocqueville (July 29, 1805\xe2\x80\x93April 16, 1859) explores in a brief, intensely insightful passage from his 1835 classic Democracy in America (public library).\nSince Tocqueville belongs to the long stretch of epochs predating Ursula K. Le Guin\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant unsexing of the universal pronoun, I have taken the liberty (a liberty I very rarely take with historical texts, for it is often ahistorical to take it, but one that feels right in this case) of rehumanizing his men as individuals and people. He writes:\nAt certain periods a nation may be oppressed by such insupportable evils as to conceive the design of effecting a total change in its political constitution; at other times\xe2\x80\xa6 the existence of society itself is endangered. Such are the times of great revolutions\xe2\x80\xa6 But between these epochs of misery and confusion there are periods during which human society seems to rest and mankind to take breath. This pause is, indeed, only apparent, for time does not stop its course for nations any more than for [individuals]; they are all advancing every day towards a goal with which they are unacquainted.\nIn an analogy the physical fact of which would become the basis of Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s epoch-making development of relativity many decades later, Tocqueville adds:\nWe imagine them to be stationary only when their progress escapes our observation, as [people] who are walking seem to be standing still to those who run.\nArt by Cindy Derby from A Velocity of Being: Letters to a Young Reader. Available as a print.\nBecause this transformative stillness is so imperceptible, Tocqueville observes, and because it appears after periods of upheaval, we are apt to mistake the stillness for an end point. Nearly two centuries before psychologist Daniel Gilbert quipped that \xe2\x80\x9chuman beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they\xe2\x80\x99re finished\xe2\x80\x9d in his excellent inquiry into how our present illusions hinder our future happiness, Tocqueville admonishes against this illusion of finality, as true on the scale of individuals as it is on the scale of societies, nations, and civilizations: \nThere are certain epochs in which the changes that take place in the social and political constitution of nations are so slow and imperceptible that [people] imagine they have reached a final state; and the human mind, believing itself to be firmly based upon sure foundations, does not extend its researches beyond a certain horizon.\nThe great gift of such periods is that they invite us to question our certitudes, our givens, these seemingly sure foundations that have lulled us into complacency \xe2\x80\x94 for it is only by being jolted out of our complacencies, cultural or personal, that we ever reach beyond the horizon, toward new territories of truth, beauty, and flourishing.   \nComplement with Thoreau on the long cycles of change, Hannah Arendt on small action as the fulcrum of our humanity, and a wonderful modern meditation on the art of waiting in an impatient culture, then revisit Pico Iyer on what Leonard Cohen taught him about the art of stillness and Pablo Neruda\xe2\x80\x99s timeless ode to silence.\n'"
b'This Is Chance: The Story of the 1964 Alaska Earthquake and the Remarkable Woman Who Magnetized People into Falling Together as Their World Fell Apart',"b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is safety, anyway? How can you predict where or when tragedy will occur? You can only learn to live with it and make the best of it when it happens.\xe2\x80\x9d'","b'\nWe might spend our lives trying to discern where we end and the rest of the world begins, but we save them by experiencing ourselves \xe2\x80\x94 our selves, each individual self \xe2\x80\x94 as \xe2\x80\x9cthe still point of the turning world,\xe2\x80\x9d to borrow T.S. Eliot\xe2\x80\x99s lovely phrase from one of the greatest poems ever written. And yet that point is pinned to a figment \xe2\x80\x94 our fundamental creaturely sense of reality is founded upon the illusion of absolute rest.\nOn March 27, 1964 \xe2\x80\x94 Good Friday \xe2\x80\x94 thousands of selves in Anchorage, Alaska came unpinned from their most elemental certitudes about reality, about safety, about the thousand small sanities by which we bestill this turning world to make it livable. \nAt 5:36PM, as the afternoon sun was slipping lazily toward the horizon \xe2\x80\x94 that quiet daily assurance that the Earth moves intact on its steady axis along its unfaltering orbital path \xe2\x80\x94 street lights began swaying, then flying. The pavement beneath them accordioned, then gaped open, swallowing cars and spitting them back up.  Walls came unseamed and reseamed before disbelieving eyes that had not yet computed, for it was beyond the computational power of everyday consciousness, what was taking place. \nPhotograph by Genie Chance, taken immediately after the earthquake hit. (Courtesy of Jan Blankenship \xe2\x80\x94 her daughter \xe2\x80\x94 and Jon Mooallem.)\nBuildings rippled \xe2\x80\x9cup and down in sections, just like a caterpillar,\xe2\x80\x9d in one observer\xe2\x80\x99s recollection, before ripping apart and crumbling completely like the brittle simulacra of safety that buildings are. Inside them, books toppled from their shelves to take rapid turns levitating from the floor, flames engulfed school science labs as chemicals crumpled together, and cast-iron pots of moose stew jumped off kitchen stoves. \nThe city\xe2\x80\x99s electric grid was snapped and uprooted \xe2\x80\x94 in the below-freezing cold, in the descending dusk, all power went out.\nPhotograph by Genie Chance, taken immediately after the earthquake hit. (Courtesy Jan Blankenship and Jon Mooallem.)\nWhen people tried running for their lives, they found their basic biped function furloughed \xe2\x80\x94 the Earth hurled each step back at them, tossing their center of gravity like a marble around a child\xe2\x80\x99s cupped hand. \nWater levels jumped as far away as South Africa. I picture my grandparents\xe2\x80\x99 well in Bulgaria undulating in the middle of the night as they slept heavily under their Rhodope wool blankets, having celebrated my mother\xe2\x80\x99s second birthday in the hours before Anchorage came unborn. \nAt 9.2 on the Richter Scale, the earthquake was more powerful than any previously measured \xe2\x80\x94 so violent that, as one seismologist phrased it, \xe2\x80\x9cit made the earth ring like a bell.\xe2\x80\x9d Just as the collision of two black holes ripples the fabric of spacetime with such brutality that it rings a gravitational wave, two tectonic plates had been in slow-motion collision for millennia, building up pressure that finally, on that early-spring afternoon, rang the planet itself and discomposed Anchorage into a level of trauma that would devastate the community, then jolt it into discovering its own entirely unfathomed wellsprings of resilience, solidarity, and generosity. \nPhotograph by Genie Chance, taken immediately after the earthquake hit. (Courtesy Jan Blankenship and Jon Mooallem.)\nDriving to the local bookstore with one of her three children was a woman who would emerge as the unlikely hero not only of the community\xe2\x80\x99s survival but of its transformation through tragedy. As their world fell apart, she would magnetize people into falling together.\nGenie Chance with dahlias, Alaska. (Courtesy Jan Blankenship and Jon Mooallem.)\nGenie Chance (January 24, 1927\xe2\x80\x93May 17, 1998) is the protagonist of Jon Mooallem\xe2\x80\x99s uncommonly wonderful book This Is Chance!: The Shaking of an All-American City, A Voice That Held It Together (public library). Driving the heart of this scrupulously researched and sensitively told story about a singular event at a particular time in a particular place is the timeless, universal pulse-beat of assurance, suddenly rendered timely to the point of prophetic \xe2\x80\x94 the assurance that comes from the lived record of communities surviving cataclysms even more savaging than our own and emerging from them stronger, more closely knit, more human. \nPhotograph by Genie Chance, taken immediately after the earthquake hit. (Courtesy Jan Blankenship and Jon Mooallem.)\nIn 1964, Anchorage had barely nursed its first generation of city-born citizens and Alaska itself had only just become a state five years earlier. The town existed, Mooallem writes, as \xe2\x80\x9ca blotch of Western civilization in the middle of emptiness,\xe2\x80\x9d on a patch of land \xe2\x80\x9coften disregarded as a kind of free-floating addendum to the rest of America.\xe2\x80\x9d Culture itself was in a state of disorientation \xe2\x80\x94 months earlier, JFK\xe2\x80\x99s assassination and The Feminine Mystique had shaken the world with their respective dissolutions of certitudes. Anchorage was hungry to pin itself on the map, to self-create an identity and then to assert it with the fiery impatience of a teenager undergoing the developmental stage of individuation \xe2\x80\x94 a city that, in one visitor\xe2\x80\x99s account, \xe2\x80\x9creached aggressively and greedily to grasp the future, impatient with any suggestion that such things take time.\xe2\x80\x9d Mooallem writes:\nThat determination made it difficult for those who lived in Anchorage to recognize how indifferently the city they were building could be knocked down \xe2\x80\x94 to imagine that, early one Friday evening, the very ground beneath them might rear up and shake their town like \xe2\x80\x9ca dog shaking an animal he\xe2\x80\x99s killed,\xe2\x80\x9d as one man later described it. Even while the earth was moving, the ferocious strangeness of what was happening to Anchorage was hard for people to internalize or accept. Buildings keeled off their foundations, slumped in on themselves, split in half or sunk. Four-foot-high ground waves rolled through the roads as though the pavement were liquid. A city of infallible right angles buckled and bent.\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as though, before the quake, people in Anchorage pictured these things happening and dismissed them as impossible; they just never pictured them. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. More to the point: Why would they? Like all of us, they looked around and registered what they saw as stable and permanent: a world that just was.\nBut there are moments when the world we take for granted instantaneously changes; when reality is abruptly upended and the unimaginable overwhelms real life. We don\xe2\x80\x99t walk around thinking about that instability, but we know it\xe2\x80\x99s always there: at random, and without warning, a kind of terrible magic can switch on and scramble our lives.\nWhen the earthquake churned its terrible magic over Anchorage, Genie Chance \xe2\x80\x94 who described herself as \xe2\x80\x9cone of those people with an insatiable curiosity who wants to understand in depth what someone else is doing, thinking, or talking about\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 was working as a part-time reporter for the local radio station, KENI. Part-time but triple-throttle: When she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t racing on her daily rounds to the police station and the courthouse to report on local crime and punishment, she flew with the air patrol on wilderness rescue missions, trailed army units during Arctic training exercises, captured life on crab boats and in Inuit villages, forewitnessed death on nuclear missile testing sites, and had to be dissuaded from climbing a fire ladder with her tape recorder during a building fire while she was recovering from pneumonia. \nGenie Chance reporting on a military exercise. (Courtesy Jan Blankenship and Jon Mooallem.)\nGenie Chance coming home from work. (Photograph Courtesy Jan Blankenship and Jon Mooallem.)\nAll of this she did before rushing home to make dinner for her three children and their father. But she inhabited these two radically different worlds as one extraordinary, integrated self \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ca woman who bore the conspicuous burden of always being fully and unflaggingly herself,\xe2\x80\x9d in Mooallem\xe2\x80\x99s lovely phrasing \xe2\x80\x94 a self outside its time and place, for being a working mother rather than a housewife was already countercultural enough, but being a working mother of unstoppable ambition covered her path with the shrapnel of shock and the indictments of arrogance with which women\xe2\x80\x99s confident competence is often repudiated. \nShe was the only female newscaster in the state and little seemed to have changed in the century-some since Margaret Fuller became America\xe2\x80\x99s first female news correspondent during a major upheaval as she was paving the way for what we now call feminism. Once, after Genie spent three days reporting on the search effort for a major airplane crash off the coast of Alaska, NBC\xe2\x80\x99s national newscast came calling for her coverage, but requested that a man be sent to redo all of her interviews for a more authoritative air on the air. But her persistent dedication to this essential community-building work soon eclipsed the dismissal and established her as the trusted voice on the radio \xe2\x80\x94 trust that threaded the community as a lifetime in the wake of the catastrophe, as fifty-two aftershocks shook the city after the initial rupture. Mooallem writes:\nAs Anchorage staggered to its feet, each person, or cluster of people, was cut off from everyone else. There was no way to know exactly what had happened, or how thoroughly their world had been jumbled.\nThis feeling of vulnerability saturated the city. One man, discovering he\xe2\x80\x99d fallen to the sandy bottom of a pit, explained, \xe2\x80\x9cYou just wonder, \xe2\x80\x98Where are you?\xe2\x80\x99 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know if anybody else is alive. Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re the last man.\xe2\x80\x9d Another remembered taking stock of the erratic transfiguration of his neighborhood and assuming that no other part of Anchorage could possibly have gotten hit so badly. Others made the opposite assumption: that the devastation they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see must be far worse. Both assumptions provoked loneliness. Each generated a slightly different species of despair.\nIt was reassuring, then, to hear another voice on the radio, talking to you \xe2\x80\x94 especially a familiar voice like Genie\xe2\x80\x99s. It urged your imagination outward, encouraged you to picture other people, still out there, listening to the radio, too.\nThat voice had risked her own life in the determination to serve \xe2\x80\x94 having ensured her family\xe2\x80\x99s safety, she had raced back downtown as buildings collapsed around her to assess what was actually going on and how she could help. She had seen things one never forgets \xe2\x80\x94 incomprehensible objects that mere hours ago had been bodies animated by human lives and loves and favorite songs \xe2\x80\x94 and she had discerned her task: to inform without alarming, to comfort without deluding, to be the steady hand in the small of the back guiding the buckle-kneed and the disoriented survivors toward safety, toward sanity, toward some version of sense-making amid the senseless ruin of their reality.  \nGenie Chance quickly grasped what our modern media have failed to grasp again and again in times of crisis: that past a certain tipping point of quantity, past a certain threshold of reliability, past a certain pitch level of delivery, facts cease to constellate into information and instead become slippery corpuscles saturating a fog of fright. Genie Chance\xe2\x80\x99s job was choice \xe2\x80\x94 she had to perform that taxing calculus of moral judgment, that ultimate curatorial task of choosing what facts to broadcast and what to withhold in order to render people maximally equipped to protect themselves and minimally inclined toward panic, which she knew would hinder all rescue and recovery efforts in what was going to be days, weeks, possibly months of people trapped together in a crippled city. \xe2\x80\x9cMass hysteria would have meant total destruction,\xe2\x80\x9d she would later recount.\nPhotograph by Genie Chance, taken immediately after the earthquake hit. (Courtesy Jan Blankenship and Jon Mooallem.)\nStationing herself at Anchorage\xe2\x80\x99s Public Safety Building as night fell on the powerless city, she began working with the police chief, the fire chief, and various officials. As soon as KENI was back on the air with a generator, she began broadcasting the essentials of survival: where to take shelter, how to purify snow for drinking water. She instructed people to limit the use of candles to the bare minimum of necessity \xe2\x80\x94 candles were a fire hazard, the city had just evaded a conflagration by what seemed like a miracle, and the water supply system was too savaged to fight a fire outbreak. \nShe then began collating eyewitness accounts to give people an accurate picture of what had just unworlded them, careful to convey the gravity of the situation without details so gruesome that people would lose hope, still performing the impossible informational acrobatics at the balance-point on the beam between paralysis and panic. Mooallem writes:\nInformation was a form of comfort. Each stunned, eye-witness account on the radio that night appeared to help people in Anchorage find the contours of this sinister abstraction they were living through \xe2\x80\x94 and to locate their places in it.\nGenie Chance (Photograph Courtesy Jan Blankenship and Jon Mooallem.)\nWithin hours, Genie Chance had become the city\xe2\x80\x99s first public information officer. But she soon became something more. Distressed people began turning up at her makeshift desk, bearing the impossible weight of not knowing whether their loved ones were dead or alive. Recognizing the psychological emergency beyond the physical first aid, Genie Chance became the human hub of a vast network of need and began broadcasting these trembling-hearted messages. \n\xe2\x80\x9cA message to Clyde Wythe at Homer: Your daughter is OK.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have received a call from Joe Fernbeck who said that he\xe2\x80\x99d gotten word on his radio from the oil crews at Beluga and Tyonek. They want their families to know that they are all OK.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a message reporting that an elderly lady at 216 East Eighth Avenue who lives alone. We have no name on her, but we do have a request for somebody in that neighborhood to please check and see if the sweet lady is all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMooallem writes:\nYou could hear the potential death toll in the city gradually ticking down. And with each small declaration of survival that aired, you could imagine a constellation of affirming flames slowly lighting the emptiness outside.\nThe words of one listener from the remote community of Clam Gulch bellow across space, time, and situation with especially poignancy and relevance today: \nIt made us who were fortunate realize that no matter what powerful forces nature unleashes, it also releases similar forces in our men and women to cope with them.\nBy Monday, as Anchorage began stumbling to its feet amid heavy snow and below-freezing temperatures, Genie Chance observed from the airwaves: \nTension is showing on the faces of a proud people. The realization that the Good Friday earthquake will have long-range repercussions on the entire state is beginning to strike at their hearts.\nShe took it upon herself to steady those hearts. How she did that \xe2\x80\x94 how she was in a position to help in the first place, having risen in radio across the personal abyss of depression and the cultural barriers of sexism; how her public service paved the way for her election to the Alaska Senate; how it illuminated what Martin Luther King, Jr. had so poetically termed a year earlier our \xe2\x80\x9cinescapable network of mutuality\xe2\x80\x9d and how it still illuminates the timeless centripetal forces holding communities together into something larger and more alive than coexisting individuals \xe2\x80\x94 that and a great, largehearted deal more is what Mooallem explores in the rest of This Is Chance!, which he ends with a gorgeous glimpse of Genie Chance\xe2\x80\x99s animating spirit.  \nGenie Chance, 1964. (Courtesy Jan Blankenship and Jon Mooallem.)\nThe week following the earthquake, when her mother wrote from Texas beseeching her to send the children there for safety, Genie had a decision to make \xe2\x80\x94 a decision that might have appeared simple to a person of less penetrating vision into the innermost pillars of survival. Beneath that surface simplicity, which rests upon a view of safety as physical security, Genie Chance fathomed the layers of complexity: The very notion of physical security had just been unmasked as an illusion in the first place, in any place; but beneath it, she suddenly saw, there lay a stratum of psychological and emotional security from which we mine the building blocks of our only reliable human shelter. She wrote back to her mother:\nI must admit that during that first dark, cold night, as I began to understand the tremendous scope of the problems that would be facing us in the months and years to come, I toyed with the idea of sending the children out on a plane to stay with you until everything settled down. Working there in the headquarters, where the reports were coming in from the survey teams throughout the city, I realized that there could possibly be a real health hazard for some time to come. I realized that the schools might not be able to resume for an indefinite period of time. It looked for a few hours as if the damage had been so extensive to all utilities and streets that even a semblance of normal life could not be resumed for weeks or months.\n[\xe2\x80\xa6]\nBut this was just a fleeting thought in a weary mind. I would have been ashamed of myself had it not been for the next thought that came so swiftly: We must be together\xe2\x80\xa6 That night I saw strain, heavy hearts, and fear in people separated from their loved ones by the sudden disaster\xe2\x80\xa6 As long as we are together, we are confident of the future\xe2\x80\xa6 \nThat Good Friday night I knew that we had survived miraculously. And for this reason, there must be a purpose to our lives. Apparently the children must sense this, too. For they have remained calm. They have been fully aware of the emergency, but they have not feared. We are proud that they are such dependable, responsible youngsters. I would not undermine their confidence in the future \xe2\x80\x94 in themselves \xe2\x80\x94 by sending them away for safety.\nWhat is safety, anyway? How can you predict where or when tragedy will occur? You can only learn to live with it and make the best of it when it happens. These children have learned this \xe2\x80\x94 and they are all the better for it. They were in the midst of devastation. And they feel that they are a part of the tremendous task ahead in rebuilding this land we love\xe2\x80\xa6 The children are not afraid. Their father and I are not afraid. Please, don\xe2\x80\x99t you fear for us.\nMooallem \xe2\x80\x94 who previously composed the beautiful, bittersweet, and surprisingly buoyant ecological elegy Wild Ones \xe2\x80\x94 reflects on the disquieting confrontation with the nature of reality that the earthquake thrust upon the world it shattered, and wrests from the disquietude the kernel of a larger truth that makes reality not only bearable but beautiful: \nWhat is safety, anyway? Genie seemed to be conceding how randomly our lives are jostled and spun around; that nothing is fixed; that even the ground we stand on is in motion. Underneath us, there is only instability. Beyond us, there\xe2\x80\x99s only chance.\nBut she\xe2\x80\x99d also recognized a way of surviving such a world. It was what Genie had created in Anchorage that weekend by talk- ing on the radio, and what she planned to stay focused on now: not an antidote to that unpredictability, exactly, but at least a strategy for withstanding it, for wringing meaning from a life we know to be unsteady and provisional. The best she and her family could do was to hold on to one another.\nOur force for counteracting chaos is connection.\n'"
